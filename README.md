# <Logo-Generator>

## Description
 
Command line application that generates a logo with a choice of 3 characters, text color, shape (cirlce, square, triangle), and shape color. The user will invoke the application using node index.js and then answers the prompts in the terminal. The file will then be written and saved as an SVG file.



## Code and Tech

I utilized VS Code in order to create js files to create the application. Jest and Node were also utilized. Used inquirer to create questions for the user to answer in the command line. Used jest to test that the shapes were rendering correctly. 


## Features

Applied functions and concepts recently learned to create a SVG logo generator in the terminal.

The user can create a custom logo by doing the following:

-Invoke app by typing node index.js in the intergrated terminal
-Pick 3 characters
-Pick a font color
-Pick a shape color
-Pick a shape with the arrow keys

The app will then run and create an SVG file that the user can then open and preview in the browser.
